# 3D Model Assets

This directory contains 3D model assets for AR features.

## Model Format
- Format: GLB or GLTF (preferred for AR)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 10MB per model)

## Current Status
- AR models are currently represented as 2D icons/overlays
- When true AR is implemented, models will be loaded from here
- Models should match the horror theme of the app

## Notes
- For now, the app uses icon placeholders for AR models
- Models are referenced by `arModelId` in clue data
